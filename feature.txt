# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Code Review Assistant

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the feature specification for an AI-powered code review assistant. This tool aims to automate parts of the code review process, helping development teams improve code quality, identify potential issues early, and streamline their workflow. The primary audience for this tool is software developers, tech leads, and quality assurance engineers.

## 2. Core Features
- **Automated Code Analysis:** The assistant will statically analyze source code to identify potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks before they are merged.
- **Style and Convention Enforcement:** It will check the code against pre-configured style guides and coding conventions to ensure consistency across the codebase.
- **Intelligent Suggestions:** The assistant will provide context-aware suggestions for code improvements, such as refactoring opportunities, simplification of complex logic, and adherence to best practices.
- **Pull Request Integration:** The tool will integrate directly with version control systems (like GitHub, GitLab) to post comments and suggestions inline on pull requests.
- **Customization:** Teams can configure the rules, checks, and standards to match their specific project requirements and coding practices.

## 3. User Stories
- As a developer, I want the AI assistant to automatically review my pull requests so that I can get immediate feedback on potential issues without waiting for a manual review.
- As a developer, I want to receive actionable suggestions for improving my code's readability and performance so that I can learn and enhance my skills.
- As a tech lead, I want to enforce our team's coding standards automatically so that I can focus my manual review efforts on architectural and logical concerns.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The code analysis should complete within a few minutes to avoid becoming a bottleneck in the development pipeline.
- **Accuracy:** The findings and suggestions from the assistant must have a low false-positive rate to maintain developer trust.
- **Scalability:** The tool must be capable of handling projects of varying sizes, from small libraries to large monolithic applications.
- **Security:** The assistant must not store or transmit any proprietary source code, and all analysis should be performed in a secure environment.

## 5. Out of Scope
- **Automated Code Formatting:** The tool will suggest changes but will not automatically reformat the code. This is left to dedicated formatters.
- **Build and Test Execution:** The assistant will not be responsible for compiling the code or running the test suite.
- **Deployment:** The tool will not handle any aspect of the deployment process.
