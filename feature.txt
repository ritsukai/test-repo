**Title:** Feature Specification: AI-Powered Code Review Assistant

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the feature specification for an AI-powered code review assistant. The assistant will be integrated into the existing developer workflow to provide automated, intelligent feedback on code changes, improving code quality and developer productivity.

**2. Problem Statement**
Developers spend a significant amount of time performing and waiting for code reviews. Manual reviews can be inconsistent, prone to human error, and a bottleneck in the development lifecycle. Junior developers may not always get high-quality, educational feedback.

**3. Goals**
- To accelerate the code review process.
- To improve the quality and consistency of code reviews.
- To provide actionable, educational feedback to developers.
- To reduce the manual effort required from senior developers for routine checks.

**4. Key Features & Functional Requirements**
- **Automated Suggestions:** The assistant will automatically analyze pull requests and provide inline comments with suggestions for improvements.
    - Suggests fixes for common bugs and logical errors.
    - Identifies performance bottlenecks.
    - Recommends improvements for code clarity and maintainability.
    - Enforces project-specific coding standards and best practices.
- **Security Vulnerability Detection:**
    - Scans for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    - Highlights insecure coding patterns.
    - Suggests secure alternatives.
- **Natural Language Interaction:**
    - Developers can ask the assistant questions about the suggested changes.
    - The assistant can explain the reasoning behind its suggestions.
    - Users can request alternative implementations.
- **Customization & Configuration:**
    - Teams can configure the assistant's rules to match their coding conventions.
    - Ability to enable/disable specific categories of checks.
    - Severity levels can be customized for different types of issues.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Performance:** The assistant should provide feedback within minutes of a pull request being created or updated.
- **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a high volume of concurrent code reviews across the organization.
- **Integration:** The assistant must seamlessly integrate with our existing version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- **Security:** All code and analysis results must be handled securely and confidentially.

**6. Out of Scope**
- Automated code merging.
- Replacing human reviewers entirely; the assistant is a tool to aid, not replace.
- Architectural-level analysis and suggestions.
- Project management or ticket-tracking functionality.
