**Feature Specification: AI-Powered Code Review Assistant**

**1. Summary**

This document outlines the feature specification for an AI-powered code review assistant. The assistant will be integrated into the existing developer workflow to provide automated, intelligent feedback on code changes, improving code quality and developer productivity.

**2. Core Features**

*   **Automated Code Analysis:** The assistant will automatically analyze pull requests for potential issues in the following areas:
    *   Code style and formatting violations.
    *   Potential bugs and logical errors.
    *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    *   Performance bottlenecks.
*   **Intelligent Feedback:** The assistant will provide context-aware comments and suggestions directly on the pull request.
    *   Comments will be clear, concise, and actionable.
    *   Suggestions will include code snippets where applicable.
    *   Feedback will be prioritized by severity (e.g., critical, major, minor).
*   **Customization and Configuration:** The assistant will be configurable to meet the specific needs of different teams and projects.
    *   Teams can enable or disable specific analysis categories.
    *   Custom rules and checks can be defined.
    *   The assistant's feedback style can be adjusted.

**3. Non-Goals**

*   The assistant will not automatically merge or reject pull requests.
*   The assistant is not a replacement for human reviewers, but a tool to augment their workflow.
*   The assistant will not provide feedback on architectural or design decisions.

**4. Technical Requirements**

*   The assistant must integrate with our current version control system (Git).
*   The analysis should be fast and not significantly delay the code review process.
*   The assistant must be highly available and reliable.
*   All feedback and analysis data should be stored securely.
