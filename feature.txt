Title: AI-Powered Code Review Assistant

1. Overview:
- This document outlines the feature specification for an AI-powered code review assistant integrated into the development workflow.
- The assistant will provide automated, intelligent feedback on code changes to improve code quality, identify potential issues, and accelerate the review process.

2. Key Features:
- Automated Code Analysis: The assistant will automatically analyze pull requests for common issues such as bugs, style violations, and performance bottlenecks.
- Intelligent Suggestions: It will provide context-aware suggestions for code improvements, including alternative implementations and best practice recommendations.
- Security Vulnerability Detection: The assistant will scan for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) and suggest remediations.

3. User Experience (UX):
- The assistant's feedback will be presented as comments directly within the pull request interface, mimicking a human reviewer.
- Developers can interact with the assistant, asking clarifying questions or requesting alternative suggestions.

4. Technical Requirements:
- The assistant will be built on a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for code analysis.
- It will integrate seamlessly with popular version control systems, starting with GitHub.
- The system must be scalable to handle a high volume of code reviews concurrently.

5. Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: The assistant should provide feedback within a few minutes of a pull request being opened.
- Accuracy: The suggestions should be highly accurate and relevant to minimize noise and false positives.

6. Out of Scope:
- Automated code refactoring or direct code commits will not be part of the initial release.
