Title: AI-Powered Code Review Assistant

1. Overview
This document outlines the feature specification for an AI-powered code review assistant. The assistant will be integrated into the existing code review process to provide automated feedback on code quality, style, and potential bugs.

2. Goals
- To reduce the time and effort required for manual code reviews.
- To improve code quality and consistency across the codebase.
- To accelerate the development lifecycle by providing faster feedback to developers.

3. Non-Goals
- This feature will not automatically merge or reject pull requests. Human oversight is still required.

4. Features
- Automated code style and formatting checks based on a configurable style guide.
- Detection of common programming errors and potential bugs (e.g., null pointer exceptions, resource leaks).
- Suggestions for code simplification and refactoring to improve readability and maintainability.
- Identification of security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

5. User Experience (UX)
- The assistant will post comments directly on the pull request, similar to a human reviewer.
- Developers can interact with the assistant by replying to its comments or using specific commands (e.g., "@ai-assistant ignore").
- A summary report of the AI's findings will be available on the pull request page.

6. Technical Requirements
- The assistant will be built as a service that integrates with our version control system via webhooks.
- It will use a combination of static analysis tools and a large language model (LLM) to analyze the code.
- The system must be scalable to handle a high volume of code reviews.

7. Metrics & Success Criteria
- A 20% reduction in the time spent on manual code reviews.
- A 15% decrease in the number of bugs reported in production.
- High developer satisfaction, measured through surveys and feedback sessions.
